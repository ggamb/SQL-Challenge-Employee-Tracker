## Description
I created this command-line employee tracker using JavaScript and mySQL2. This application will allow you to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in your company, along with additional features under production. This project uses a database schema to create roles, employees, and departments and will add new roles, employees, and departments to the database based on user input.

## Installation

To run this code, clone the code above, navigate to the correct directory, open it in your IDE, and run `npm install` in the terminal to install all dependencies. Then, create the SQL database schema and seed the database by logging into mySQL with the `mysql -u root -p` command, entering your password, and then running `source db/schema.sql;` and `source db/seeds.sql;` in the mySQL terminal. Leave the mySQL terminal with `quit;`.

Then, type `npm start` to run the code.
